# Football-management
## Teacher's assignments
A football team (or ice hockey team, or some other team) needs a program to store results of games. The names and player numbers of the players are read from a file and added to a combo box, so that it is easy for the user to pick a player when adding points/goals. The user can add a game: the date, the name of the opponent, the game result, and the names of the players of this team that made some points/goals, and how many points/goals. (You can add more data, like penalties, if you want.) The user can somehow choose a game and see the data. Games can be saved to a file and read from a file.
The user can choose if she/he wants to get some statistics of the points/goals: how many points/goals in total each of the players have got, and the program prints the result in descending order.
